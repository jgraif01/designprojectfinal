  <h1 id="h6"> The Best of K-pop Fashion </h1>
    
  <h4 id="h4"> There are many executions of amazing outfits in K-pop. They always match the song, concept, and the members match each other. For today’s example, I will be breaking down Twice’s Cry For Me outfits and why they are some of the best in K-pop fashion. 
    <br> <br> 
    There are 5 main elements in these costumes that make the girls match each other so well: 
    <ul>
    <li> Specially detailed corsets/belts. </li>
    <li> Ruffles. </li>
    <li>Chokers. </li>
    <li>Sheer fabric.</li>
    <li>High heels.</li>
</ul>
    <br> <br> 
    All of these elements are used for the girls outfits more than once. Making them compliment each other properly. The same colour palette is used as well; white, silver and black. Everyone’s outfit works individually, and as a group. They all look absolutely stunning. 
    <br> <br> 
    The concept for Cry For Me is what is called a “Mature” concept. Unlike Twice’s other cutesy and girl crush title tracks, Cry For Me has more of a sophisticated and grown up theme to it. Twice had been wanting to try this new concept for a while, and it is a really good concept for them. In a more mature concept, typically darker colours are imagined, liked grey, black, etc. 
    <br> <br> 
    The outfits are extremely appealing to the eye, match well, and fit the concept. Therefore, making them perfect for this stage. </h4>
