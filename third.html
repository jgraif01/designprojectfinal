  <h1 id="h6"> The Best Executed Concept </h1>
    
  <h4 id="h4"> Concepts can be difficult to execute, whether they’re mature, cute or cool, they can be very hard to style. 
 <br> <br>
    In most cases, like here, Tomorrow X Together’s Blue Orangeade, concepts are styled very well. The concept of the song “Blue Orangeade” is very fun and childish. Blue Orangeade is about complimenting each other’s personalities in a relationship. The vibe of the song is very upbeat and fun. Even the title of the song Blue Orangeade sounds like a sports drink flavour. The song and concept are very colourful and are full of fun tones. 
    <br> <br>
    For this stage, the boys are dressed in very vibrant colours. There is an array of neons, and hot colours. The outfits have sort of a childish vibe to them, matching the tone of the song. Every boy is wearing a belt, and they are wearing colours that compliment each other. There are even a few rainbows in their outfits. 
    <br> <br>
    In conclusion, their outfits match the vibe of the song very well and the concept of the song was very well executed.  </h4>
