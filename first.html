  <h1 id="h6"> The Worst of K-pop Fashion </h1>
    
  <h4 id="h4"> Fashion is universal. There isn’t necessarily a right or wrong. Most of the time, fashion is based solely on personal opinions. There are still some elements that can distinguish good from bad fashion. To take this stage for example. This stage was Red Velvet’s Zimzalabim. Not only was the song questionable, but so were the outfits. They were meant to fit the funky theme of the song. The song was about to be about magic and creativity, but the sound of it adds a weird experimental vibe to it. There is a lot of evidence from fans all over the world who dislike the outfits from this stage. Multiple articles state that they dislike the outfits and why. Korean netizens even called the outfits “Hideous”. Source: https://kissasian.is/koreans-hate-red-velvet-zimzalabim-showcase-outfits-call-hideous.html 
    <br> <br> Let’s break down each outfit. I have labelled each member and I will be evaluating them individually, then as a group. 
    
    <br> <br> Yeri: Yeri’s outfit is probably my favourite out of all of them. Her outfit is for the most part, well matched and put together. The only thing that throws me off is the choice of shoes and accessories. Yeri is shown wearing a chunky blue necklace which does not match the theme of her flowly dressy and is only accented by one hint of blue on the dress. The shoes also hardly match anything in the outfit except for the splatters of paint on her dress. But the paint is so small, it’s so hard to match. A black shoe option would be better for this outfit. 
    <br><br>
    Joy: 
    Joy’s outfit is interesting. Mostly nothing in her outfit matches, or works together, which is incredibly important when it comes to styling. The corset top with a hanging skirt is very cool, but it could have been styled differently. The miniskirt and tights beneath it simply don’t match the rest of the outfit. In the miniskirt, there are hints of vibrant hot pink which are seen nowhere else on the outfit. The tights beneath the miniskirt also do not match anything else but the extremely chunky choker necklace. The green on the outfit clashes with the pastel purples, pinks and blues. It’s an odd colour to accent with, which is what makes her outfit so odd. Another weird thing about her outfit, is the glove. The pink and purple glove somewhat matches the skirt, but the jewelry does not. A random orange bracelet, and vibrant blue ring? It’s incredibly random. The hair also does not match the vibe of the outfit. Her hair is in braids, when the very feminine, princess-y vibe of the outfit would look better with her hair down. 
    <br><br>
    Irene: Irene is also one of my favourite outfits here. Almost everything in her outfit matches well. The neon green top although, does not match her darker green and orange corset. A black top would look better and match the shorts she’s wearing. The vibrant blue socks as well, don’t make any sense as they match NOTHING else on the outfit. An orange or green shoe choice would be a much better fit. Her earrings are very odd, purple and red accent earrings that don’t match the colour palette of the outfit.. 
    <br><br>
    Seulgi: 
    Seulgi’s outfit is easily the worst one here. Nothing on her outfit matches and everything is clashing. The outfit was not composed well as it contains multiple different themes (Which can work if executed properly). Her top is shown as a city-pop dancer vibe along with her shoes, but her skirt has more of an artistic, mature concept to it. Her top is blue and pink, and does not match anything else on the outfit. The red and off-white skirt clashes majorly with the blues and pinks of her top. The mismatched prints from the top to the bottom were not executed well and do not look good. The choice of jewelry is even worse. The orange band on her wrist matches NOTHING on the outfits and is completely random. It does not accent any of the colours shown. The outfit has the oddest colour pattern I have ever seen.  
    <br><br>
    Wendy: 
    This outfit has become and iconic statement piece throughout K-pop because of the awful top. It literally looks like she’s wearing a rug from the early 2000s era. Not only is this shirt extremely difficult to style, but it is unappealing to the eye. The tights seem to make it worse. Overpowering black which does match the vibrant vibe of the red and green. The black should be accented instead and not overpowering to the rest of the outfit. The shoe choice was odd as well, a small heel that doesn’t match the outfit. Quite interesting. 
    <br> <br>
    Altogether, the girls don’t really match each other. Some are wearing vibrant shades and some have pastel or off-white shades. Nothing works together and it looks as if they’re all from different groups executing different concepts. Outfits in groups should be collaborated together and somewhat match, typically using similar colour palettes and themes. </h4>
